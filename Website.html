	<h2> Message From Chairman </h2>
	<p> "The process of learning and achievement of excellence is a legacy of our glorious past. 
	    The chronicles of history bear witness to the fact that our predecessors pioneered and 
            made gigantic leaps in various branches of sciences. We, therefore, are custodians of 
            a trust vested in us. The turn of events and transgression from destined path have tilted 
            the scales against us. At this point of time, vision with unflinching faith in our cause 
            should be the guiding principle to turn the wheel and arrest further degradation of our potentials. 
            A big task lies ahead to revive and restore the ascendancy of our predecessors to its 
            rightful place in today’s modern world. Let us join hands to carry this noble mission 
           to conclusive end under the banner of University of Engineering & Technology, Lahore. 
           I have faith in our mission and with the blessing of Allah we will Inshallah reach the 
          zenith of fulfillment and achievement." </p>
